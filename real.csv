Also, if you are searching through your shows and you click on it and then go back, you go back to the very beginning. When looking through 'recorded shows', you scroll through a ton then you can hit see more and again it takes you back to the beginning. The show selection is good and I am happy with that part of it but it gets old doing all the scrolling when they could improve the interface and make it a lot easier to see what you have to watch.

4.0,Very comprehensive and easy to use; installation instructions were useless,"Over the years I have used many different antivirus and internet security products including AVG, Panda, Trend Micro, Symantec (Norton), Bitdefender, McAfee, Webroot, Avast!, Vipre (GFI) and various others.  They all had strengths and weaknesses and eventually I would have to abandon one and move on to another.  I finally settled on one that I have used for a number of years now.  Unfortunately that product had slipped in the ratings in recent years and my subscription was about to run out so decided to try Kaspersky, which I had read very good things about.  Keep in mind that these days a simple anti-virus program isn't enough to keep you secure.  You either need to use multiple products that protect from different kinds of threats or you need a more comprehensive package of protection.  The best security products also now include checking for updates on common programs that most computers have (such as browsers).  Kaspersky Total Security has that.  They also have built in secure browser capability, so you can do online banking without worrying about data being exposed (called Safe Money) and another one called secure connection.  It wasn't clear what the difference between the two is and secure connection is limited to 200mb a day unless you pay extra to remove the limitation.  There is a lot in the product including the ability to encrypt files, a password manager and a system vulnerability scanner and fixer.  It even includes a backup and restore program and parental controls.  It doesn't seem too resource hungry, which is why I had to abandon some products in the past; they just slowed the computer too much.  Overall, it seems like a really nice package and rates highly in virus detection.  You won't go wrong buying this product.  So why only 4 stars?  Well, I am rating the specific package that I got.  I was disappointed when I opened the package, because it is nothing except an activation key and a few pages of instructions.  I ran into problems right away with the instructions.  It recommends signing up at my.kaspersky.com where you can enter and manage your license(s).  I tried repeatedly to add my license after signing up and could not do it; kept getting the message that it wasn't able to and to try again later.  Finally it just said the license had expired.  I gave up and used a different tactic and I recommend you do this too if you buy one of these license packages.  I just went to the main website, downloaded and installed the product.  Then when I ran it, it requested the activation key, which I entered.  Everything went fine then.  A word about support.  When I ran into the difficultly on my.kaspersky.com, I contacted support and they responded very quickly in just a few hours.  I hope this is an indication of their usual levels of support.  I was impressed.  You won't go wrong with Kaspersky, but remember nothing will protect you completely.  There is no substitute for practicing safe computing.  Update: Kaspersky will not install on Windows XP if your disks are FAT32.  Your disks have to be NTFS.  You can convert from FAT32 to NTFS, but there are risks of losing your data if you do that.",[],B01KICHCJ6,B01KICHCJ6,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,1479488037000,19,False
4.0,"VERY COMPLEX, RICH PROGRAM WITH BIG LEARNING CURVE","I have used simple drawing programs before, but thought it was time to really try a full featured one.  The install of this program went perfectly; no issues at all and was easy; just a few simple questions to answer.  It does take a while to install; about 1/2 hour or so on my older PC.  The program loads quickly and runs well, even though it is a big program consisting of 5 separate components.  It seems comprehensive enough to do any and all graphics work that you might want to accomplish.  I was able to create some simple objects and fill them with various colors and text fairly quickly.  The programs include some basic tutorials that help you get started, but they aren't extensive enough to really learn the product comprehensively.  The box shows some gorgeous drawings that were created with the program.  The problem is that you won't be able to quickly create anything that is even close to as good in just a short time.  This program takes a real learning commitment.  Some things are intuitive, but not everything.  If you haven't used a somewhat sophisticated drawing program previously, it will take some time to get up to speed with this.  I felt a bit overwhelmed.  It's not that there is anything difficult that I encountered; just so much to learn before you can do that much.  Some of the terminology had me confused and the number of toolbars and items on them is overwhelming at first.  There are tool and menu bars across the top of the screen and toolbars down both sides too.  The bars change too, depending on what you are doing.  The sheer number of different controls and buttons requires a big time commitment to learn this complex program.  It probably also helps to have some drawing skill, especially with a mouse.  After working with the main drawing program for a while, I got the feeling that to master this would require a training course.  Teaching yourself to use this in the way you want would take far longer than learning it in a class.  I didn't spend time looking to see if there were other tutorials or training courses available.  I only knocked off one star in my review for the difficulty in learning the product in order to use in an effective way.  The product includes access to a lot of on-line art, which is a plus, although I noticed some of that art had watermarks, which would render it less usable and might require an additional subscription fee to remove the watermarks.  There is plenty of art that doesn't have the watermarks and you can always capture images or use your own photos as well.  If you want a complete, comprehensive drawing program, this is it.  Just be prepared to spend a lot of hours learning.  I tested on Windows 7, but I'm sure it works fine on 8 and 10 as well.<br />It has both 32 and 64 bit versions on the disk.",[],B01CCBESDE,B01CCBESDE,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,1462041769000,1,False
5.0,VERY IMPRESSIVE,"The install of this product was effortless.  Unlike most software, I didn't even have to reboot after the install was done.  I tested a long, complex PDF document and Omnipage did a very good job of converting it into editable text.  It even extracted embedded illustrations, which is something that I did not expect.  This product can save countless hours of retyping a document that you only have a copy of.  Why waste time doing that?  Just read the document into Ominpage and it does the work for you.  Just be careful not to plagiarize anything.  Yes, the program made a few mistakes, but in almost every case, it prompted to about the issue. OCR recognition has come a lot way and this is a program that undoubtedly leads the pack.",[],B004YTG200,B00MEM71DG,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,1309499877000,0,False
3.0,Reasonably Good Security Product,"In the past I used Webroot products, but finally abandoned them as they just took too many resources and slowed my system.  This newer version appears to have been trimmed down a lot, so it should run fast enough on most systems.  My system is rather old, so not as responsive as newer systems with better processors and more memory.  The first scan of my system took under 2 hours, which is about the same as most other products that I have used.  My main criticism of the scanner is that it comes up with a lot of mostly harmless cookies.  That's nice if you really want to clean your system well, but can be misleading in making you think that this product is catching so much more than others, since other scanners often ignore most cookies.  I seem to recall a lot more features in older versions of this software; this version appears to be stripped down somewhat.  That's probably a good thing, as you don't want your security software too complicated or difficult to set up.  It is better if it sits quietly doing it's thing without needing a lot of tweaks.  This seems like an adequate security program for most needs, but apparently lacks a firewall.  I am not overly impressed with it, but it still holds it's own reasonably well against competitors.  I just think there are somewhat better security programs available.",[],B003SEVL8U,B003SEVL8U,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,1293727689000,0,False
4.0,Unparalled Protection,"I have used Panda Antivirus for many years and I can't recall ever getting a virus or at least none that caused any damage.  Once in a while I will check my system with another scanner just to see if Panda is preventing viruses and it appears to be doing an excellent job.  Rarely do I ever find any viruses that are able to slip by Panda.  You won't find a better antivirus prevention program.  It also does a good job on automatic updates.  It's non-intrusive and runs quietly in the background.  The additional protection of the firewall is a plus and the firewall seems to work well too.  Generally I don't like bundled packages, but this combination seems to work flawlessly.  The firewall doesn't have much configurability, so if that's important to you, you might want to just get the antivirus product instead of the combo, but you can turn off the firewall if you want.  The real downside to Panda is that sometimes the install can be a nightmare.  I don't recall having much of an issue with the 2007 version, but some earlier versions were just horrendous.  If you can deal with a sometimes quirky install and finally get it working, the payoff is well worth the struggle.  Some of the easier to install, better known competitors just don't provide as much protection.  Something else to be aware of is that Webroot SpySweeper (a popular anti-spyware program) had some serious conflicts with Panda's scan.  This is not the fault of Panda and Webroot has corrected most of the conflicts in their current version.  There still appears to be one big conflict, but there is a workaround for it.  Panda's support can be a little spotty at times.  Sometimes I have gotten good response; other times it has been a bit slow.  They always seem to respond even if it takes a while.  Since the product works so well once up and running it is rare that you would even need support; most likely you'll need it an install time.  If you are building a new system, install it early and you shouldn't have any issues.  As security products tend to get more comprehensive, there are a bound to be more conflicts and if you try to run multiple products you can have difficulty.  Panda seems no worse (and no better) than any others in that regard.  I highly recommend it even with the caveats mentioned here.",[],B000IMXUGG,B000IMXUGG,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,1165338257000,5,False
4.0,"Worked well for me, but follow instructions carefully","I wanted to install XP without losing Windows 2000, so I followed the instructions with Partition Magic very carefully and everything worked extremely well.  There were a couple of minor glitches, but overall things went much better than I expected.  This is a good product, but it is not for the novice. You need to understand the types of partitions and all the issues involved.  There is an antimated tutorial that comes with the product and it is very well done and explains some of what you need to know before you proceed.  You also MUST create the recovery disks that are recommended.  At one point, without the diskettes, I would have been unable to get to one of my partitions and would have had a difficult time getting that partition back.  Also backup is recommended, as is checking your disk for errors.  If you don't follow the instructions very carefully and understand what you are doing, I can easily see where you could end up with a big mess on your hands.  You may need to know how to change your BIOS settings too, in order to boot from a CD, if the OS you are trying to install is on a CD.  While a novice might get through it all, this tool is definately better used by those who understand how to install operating systems and how disks are structured and partitioned.  I suspect that some exotic configurations with odd disks or operating systems could easily be trashed by this product.  It's very powerful and I am extremely pleased that it did what it claimed to be able to do, on my system.  Again, if you decide to buy this, it is very important that you read the documentation, view the tutorial and understand what the product is doing and what you are doing.  One downside that I encountered is that my USB2 drive is apparently not supported, as PM shows it as BAD, even though the documentation says it supports USB2.  Don't buy it with expectations that it will work on a USB drive.  I have to say that Symantec has a way of dumbing-down some of their products to the point that they aren't as good anymore as when they were owned by other companies.  Although I don't have experience with prior versions of Partition Magic, I do have experience with a couple other products that they bought from other companies.  Their versions just don't measure up to the originals.  Symantec often gets beat up for poor products, but I think it is partly because thier products are in such wide use.<br /><br />You can't cover every quirky system out there and the more widely your product is used, the more potential problems.  For me, it is a love/hate relationship; I can't live with them and I can't live without them.",[],B00025O87E,B00025O87E,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,1117325596000,4,False
1.0,Total garbage,"Absolutely worthless. The GUI elements display far too large for me to be able to click on anything, and of course there is no support, no bug documentation, no help, no concept that this might be a problem for someone and helpful steps for how to solve it. The tutorials and help guides say ""just click the button and it works."" Except when you can't click the button because it's too far off screen. Moving the windows around doesn't help because, guess what, they can't be resized or minimized at all. And no, my laptop's resolution isn't tiny. It's actually full HD.<br /><br />The latest update also breaks the program so that it doesn't even load, which ironically, works about as good as when it is able to load correctly. Plenty of annoying dialogs, large GUI elements that don't display properly, and zero actual usefulness. A usefully designed GUI would be made so that it could be used even when things like this happen. For example, in 99% of modern user interfaces, pressing ENTER clicks on the 'continue/OK' button automatically, regardless of where said button is located (even if off screen). In Magix Fastcut, pressing ENTER does nothing. You're forced to stare at a stupidly large GUI with no clue how to make it do what it's supposed to do.<br /><br />The program is a waste of money. Don't expect it to work, or receive any support or help. The only thing you'll find online is other posts by other frustrated users who had the same issue and were unable to solve it.",[],B00PVNFJSO,B00UCGNJ14,AGU7O3UW7U2UMZGSZMKNZ6K6VHUA,1557202829243,0,False

It will introduce you to grammar, pronunciation, culture, and common phrases. Native speakers are a plus, but I did not like the fact that languages that made use of symbols rather than letters were Romanized, such as Japanese, Chinese, Arabic, etc. In the long run it is much more difficult to pick up the symbols after learning the language.<br />Still, this is a great product at a reasonable price for anyone with an interest in languages, either learning for the first time or for reviewing.

One feature I love is the built-in ad blocker -- makes most ads in websites disappear. (It does NOT do this by default -- you choose it in settings). Since you must purchase a renewal every year, I like the fact that I am able to buy the software at drastically reduced cost. Not so with some other providers.<br /><br />I have used Kaspersky off and on for years, I have never had a major attack, and the minor ones have been prevented or dispatched quickly. If you have never used this software, give it a try. I think you will be glad you did.",[],B00LC9UU6C,B00MFW973C,AF7J5A2ME55LSCRVQWXB3BKE7CHQ,1430778105000,1,True
5.0,"Unobtrusive, Effective Protection for Old and New PCs Alike","Over the last ten years I have tried most of the major internet security suites (including Kaspersky, BitDefender, McAfee, Eset). I was always searching for a suite that would work well on my workhorse 2002 Dell as well as more recent systems (newer desktop, laptops, notebook). It was not easy to find one piece of software that was equally effective for old and new alike. Some of the other programs slowed my older PC to a crawl. For the past three years I have used the Norton internet security suite and I believe I now have the ideal choice for all of my computers.<br /><br />Norton Internet Security is very unobtrusive. Most of the time I do not even know it is there. There are no glitches on my older Dell. For this I am grateful. My newer computers run flawlessly with this software.<br /><br />Now the one feature that has ""hooked me for life"" is Norton's Identity Safe. This component saves all of your UIDs and passwords on your PC. You can see each combination whenever you wish. Identity Safe will ask you if you want to save any changes you make whenever you make them. With this component you can do the prudent thing: you can use as many different UIDs and password combos as you wish; in this way you avoid using the same combination for every account you have. Experts recommend that you use different passwords (instead of the same UID-password for every account you have) so that there is not a single ""key"" to all of your internet account ""doors.""<br /><br />If you are looking for a set-and-forget security system that is minimally intrusive and does not hog your computer's resources, give Norton a try.",[],B005GI19HY,B004669QS6,AF7J5A2ME55LSCRVQWXB3BKE7CHQ,1324013978000,1,True

It would have been nice to be able to order it on disc and save the download time.  Fortunately, my ISP doesn't charge by the gigabyte or impose a data limit.  I probably should have just downloaded Word, as that's all I ever use, but the whole Office 365 program isn't much more expensive than Word alone.
